# Farm by RDOGS
Farm by RDOGS is a re-think of social media web application, which aims to create a more organic way for friends and communities to interact.


## Motivation
Post, comments, and reactions are the three most common elements in modern social web applications, and most of the time, it follows some rather 'linear' UI designs such as timelines and post lists. 

Farm by RDOGS attempts to free the elements from these structures, and let the users (or 'farmers') decide where their contents ('plants') should be placed on a 2D grid (a 'farm'). 

We envision that, in this way, not only does the communities have a larger freedom and room for creativity, the interactions and discussions could also 'grow' natually as the clustered posts, comments, and reactions clusters (implying a bigger trend), just like a real farm growing plants.
